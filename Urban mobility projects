Urban mobility projects aim to address transportation challenges in urban areas, promoting sustainable, efficient and inclusive transportation solutions. Here are various types of urban mobility projects : 
Public transit enhancements : 
1. Bua rapid transit (BRT) system - Implement BRT system with dedicated bus lanes, improved stations, and intelligent traffic management for efficient mass transit.
2. Light rail transit (LRT) systems - develop light rail network to provide a fast, reliable, and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional bus system.
3. Automated metro system - introduce automated metro systems to enhance capacity, reduce wait times, and improve overall urban transit efficiency.

Shared mobility solutions : 
1. Bike-share programs - Establish bike-share programs with strategically located station to encourage cycling as a sustainable mode of transportation.
2. E-scooter sharing - Implement e-scooter sharing programs, allowing users to rent electric scooters for short-distance travel within urban areas.
3. Car-share and carpooling platforms - Support car-sharing services and carpooling platforms to reduce indiviual car ownership and alleviate traffic congestion.

Pedestrian-Friendly  infrastructure :
1. Urban greenways and pedestrian zones - create urban greenways and pedestrain zones to enhance walkability, providing safe and pleasant spaces for pedestrians.
2. Smart crosswalks and pedestrain signals : implement smart crosswalk with sensors and pedestrian signals to improve safety and streamline pedestrian traffic.
